       "       \" eight months into their stay on mars, the life-sciences specialist discovers a microbial fossil. subsequent to this, the crew begin to suffer various mishaps, including damage to mission property and direct attacks upon themselves. complicating the situation is the apparent psychiatric breakdown of the mission commander and his definite attempts to injure or kill his fellow crewmembers. on earth, the mars mission director, working with an agent of the fbi, races to discover who sabotaged the mission before the crew even arrived on mars—and who might be trying to strand the crew on mars now that they're on it. he is shocked to discover that his own flight director committed the initial sabotage—he was trying to seed mars with a bacterium that would be taken as evidence of life on mars, thus ensuring continued funding of project ares, the official name for the program. but when the life-sciences specialist falls ill from an actual microbial infection—from live bacteria which she has subsequently discovered—the mishaps multiply, with a corresponding increase in the physical danger to the crew. someone other than the flight director is responsible for this. at the very end, that someone is revealed to be a nasa engineer who fears that the crew, now on their way back to earth, are bringing back a germ that could potentially kill millions of people—this although the crew clearly showed that the germ was sensitive to the antibiotics they had carried with them. the mission ends with the psychiatrically challenged commander sacrificing his own life to save the rest of the crew—and the marriage of the two mission specialists aboard their earth return vehicle.\",\n",
       "       ' karl sten is a young boy growing up on an industrial factory world called vulcan. sten\\'s parents are little better than indentured servants, always wanting to raise their children somewhere else, but never able to \"buy out\" their contracts and leave. after sten\\'s family is killed in an industrial cover-up initiated by vulcan\\'s ceo, baron thoresen, sten rebels against the laws of vulcan and escapes to live on his own in the background of the factory world. for several years he runs with the delinqs, a band of young outlaws that have also rejected the ideals of the company. one day he saves an off-worlder, ian mahoney, from a security team. mahoney is the head of imperial intelligence and is trying to gather information on a special project baron thoresen is running. mahoney offers sten and his gang a chance to leave vulcan if they can get the information he needs. unfortunately, during the mission they are discovered and sten is apparently the only one who makes it back alive. true to his word, ian takes sten off the hellhole of his birth, but enlists him the military to keep him safe. during imperial guards training, sten proves to be square peg for the traditional military, but perfect for the super secret cia-type covert branch of intelligence that ian heads, called mantis. while in mantis, sten excels and becomes the head of team 13, with alex kilgour, a heavy worlder from new edinburgh, (who has a rather ill-tempered view of the campbell clan) as his second in command. eventually, the eternal emperor assigns team 13 to bring down the government of vulcan so the baron\\'s secret project can be unmasked. team 13 accomplishes this by organizing a rebellion, which gets out of control and almost tears apart the factory world in a heated frenzy. sten and team 13 finish the job up with sneakiness, judicious violence and a few well placed explosions. sten confronts his parents killer, baron thorenson, and kills him by ripping his heart out with his bare hands. at the conclusion of the novel, while being dressed down for killing thoresen against the emperor\\'s orders, ian promotes sten to lieutenant. it seems the emperor had thought better of his order not to kill the baron but had not been able to get word to the team in the field. a great future seems to be in store for our hero.',\n",
       "       ' the hunger games takes place in a nation known as panem, established in north america after the destruction of the continent\\'s civilization by an unknown apocalyptic event. the nation consists of the wealthy capitol and twelve surrounding, poorer districts united under the capitol\\'s control. district&nbsp;12, where the book begins, is located in the coal-rich region that was formerly known as appalachia. as punishment for a past rebellion against the capitol, in which a 13th district was destroyed, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12&nbsp;and 18&nbsp;from each district are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the hunger games, an event in which the participants (or \"tributes\") must fight to the death in an outdoor arena controlled by the capitol, until only one individual remains. the story is narrated by 16-year-old katniss everdeen, a girl from district&nbsp;12 who volunteers for the 74th annual hunger games in place of her younger sister, primrose. the male tribute chosen from district&nbsp;12 is peeta mellark, a former schoolmate of katniss who once gave her bread from his family\\'s bakery when her family was starving. katniss and peeta are taken to the capitol, where their drunken mentor, haymitch abernathy, victor of the 50th hunger games, instructs them to watch and determine the strengths and weaknesses of the other tributes. \"stylists\" are employed to make each tribute look his or her best; katniss\\'s stylist, cinna, is the only person at the capitol with whom she feels a degree of understanding. the tributes are publicly displayed to the capitol audience in an interview with television host caesar flickerman, and have to attempt to appeal to the television audience in order to obtain \"sponsors\". during this time, peeta reveals on-air his longtime unrequited love for katniss. katniss believes this to be a ploy to gain sponsors, who can be critical to survival because of their ability to send gifts such as food, medicine, and tools to favored tributes during the games. while nearly half the tributes are killed in the first day of the games, katniss relies on her well-practiced hunting and survival skills to remain unharmed and concealed from the other tributes. a few days into the games, katniss develops an alliance with rue, a 12-year-old girl from the agricultural district&nbsp;11 who reminds katniss of her own sister. in the meantime, peeta appears to have joined forces with the tributes from the richer districts. however, when he has the opportunity to kill katniss, he instead saves her from the others. katniss\\'s alliance with rue is brought to an abrupt end when rue is killed by another tribute, whom katniss then kills with an arrow. katniss sings to rue until she dies, and spreads flowers over her body as a sign of respect for rue and disgust towards the capitol. apparently because of katniss and peeta\\'s image in the minds of the audience as \"star-crossed lovers\", a rule change is announced midway through the games, allowing two tributes from the same district to win the hunger games as a couple. upon hearing this, katniss begins searching for peeta. she eventually finds him, wounded and in hiding. as she nurses him back to health, she acts the part of a young girl falling in love to gain more favor with the audience and, consequently, gifts from her sponsors. when the couple remain as the last two surviving tributes, the gamemakers reverse the rule change in an attempt to force them into a dramatic finale, where one must kill the other to win. katniss, knowing that the gamemakers would rather have two victors than none, retrieves highly poisonous berries known as \"nightlock\" from her pouch and offers some to peeta. realizing that katniss and peeta intend to commit suicide, the gamemakers announce that both will be the victors of the 74th hunger games. although she survives the ordeal in the arena and is treated to a hero\\'s welcome in the capitol, katniss is warned by haymitch that she has now become a political target after defying her society\\'s authoritarian leaders so publicly. afterwards, peeta is heartbroken when he learns that katniss\\'s actions in the arena were part of a calculated ploy to earn sympathy from the audience. however, katniss is unsure of her own feelings and realizes that she is dreading the moment when she and peeta will go their separate ways.',\n",
