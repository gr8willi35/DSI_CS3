# DSI_CS3

Proposal:
  I want to analyze the food data center API and perform EDA. I will model food types and and work on modeling something.
  Unsupervised because I don't know what to predict.
 question on how to do multiple iterations of API .
  Maybe make a predictions on whether or not a food is healthy or a meal is healthy.  Maybe group foods somhow.
  
  Food Data Central has a api that seems pretty nice to use.
  
  Next steps are to pull lots of rows of data and see what is available
